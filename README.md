# Chess Capture Program

## Description

This program allows users to simulate a simple chess scenario where a single white chess piece attempts to capture one or more black chess pieces on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The program determines and displays which black pieces the white piece can potentially capture based on standard chess movement rules.
